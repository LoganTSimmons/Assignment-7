# Assignment-7

1. Create some tests (at least one per function) that you want your hashtable to pass before you start coding.

2. Create a hashtable that resolves collisions by simply overwriting the old value with the new value, including at least:

    1. Describe the way that you decide on hashing a value
      (this can be simple or complex based on how interesting you find the topic)

    2. An insert function that places the value at the appropriate location based on its hash value

    3. A contains function that returns whether the value is already in the hashtable

    4. (optional) A delete function that removes a value based on its hash and then returns that valueâ€¦

3. Then create a smarter hashtable (double hashing or chaining) including at least the same functions as the simple hashtable

4. Compare some information relating to collisions (frequency) and their effect on complexity (of insert and contains methods)
